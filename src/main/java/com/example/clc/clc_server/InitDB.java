Inspired by the lives of Young Hollywood stars like River Phoenix, Corey Feldman, Heath Ledger and Corey Haim, Famous takes you on a non-stop thrill ride behind the glamorous world of Young Hollywood and into the mind of A-list celebrity, Jason Mast. What appears to be a night of celebration for his first Oscar nomination, turns out to be an intricate plan to confront his past. Driven by a devastating need to expose the truth, Jason attempts to control the outcome of the evening and ignites a chain of events that pushes the boundaries of real friendship and reveals the true cost of fame. â€”Michael Leoni",

Not begrudgingly tolerate. H-A-T-E. Lucy can't understand Josh's joyless, uptight approach to his job and refusal to smile, which is in stark contrast to her bright clothes, quirkiness, and effusive people-pleasing. Trapped in a shared office 5 days a week, they've become entrenched in an addictive, ridiculous never-ending game of one-upmanship. Lucy can't let Josh beat her at anything - especially when a huge new promotion to be Managing Director is up for grabs. They strike a deal that whoever does not get the promotion must quit. It's game-on - But as tensions reach boiling point and an innocent elevator ride turns into a steamy kiss, Lucy begins to realize just how fine a line there is between love and hate.",
